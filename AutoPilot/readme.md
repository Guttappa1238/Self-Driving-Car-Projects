## Autopilot
This code helps in getting the steering angle of self driving car. The inspiraion is taken from [Udacity Self driving car](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3) module as well [End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/) module from NVIDIA

The End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars research paper can be found at (https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316)
This repository uses convnets to predict steering angle according to the road. 


### Description
An autonomous car (also known as a driverless car, self-driving car, and robotic car) is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Autonomous cars combine a variety of techniques to perceive their surroundings, including radar, laser light, GPS, odometry, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.
