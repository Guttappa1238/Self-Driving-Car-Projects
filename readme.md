This repository contains many autonomous vehicle-related projects I've worked on. This might serve as the foundation for a real autonomous vehicle.

# Projects

## Basic Lane Line Detection
Employ region of interest selection, grayscaling, Gaussian smoothing, Canny Edge Detection and Hough Transform line detection to identify lane lines on the road in an image.

## Advanced Lane Line Detection
Find lane markings in images and video using color transformations, gradients, and perspective transformation. Determine the curvature of the lane and the vehicle position with respect to center.

## Behavioral Cloning
Use Udacity's driving simulator to create a dataset to clone driving behavior by training and validating a model using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

## Autopilot
Use End-to-End architecture to train a CNN model that predicts a steering angle, trained on real world dataset.
